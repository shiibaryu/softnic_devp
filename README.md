## What is this?
This is a development platform for Ethernet NICs in software, but connected with hardware PCIe elements. <br>
In this platform, researchers and developers can easily prototype new designs of interaction between <br>
an Ethernet device in software and a driver for a hardware NIC over the physical PCIe links. <br>
